<p>My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/acoreynews">Alex Corey</a> and here's some of my work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://newamericamedia.org/2014/12/csus-lag-behind-ucs-in-creating-dream-centers.php">CSUs lag behind UCs in creating "Dream Centers"</a> - New America Media - Our bilingual campus publication has been covering issues affecting undocumented students for years. When I saw that some CSU campuses were trying to create centers I decided to investigate why UCs had more resources despite serving fewer students in this situation. I met with sources in Long Beach, Los Angeles and the Valley in order to better understand the issue.</p></li>  


<li><p><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/program-puts-child-deportations-thrives-nevada">Program that puts off child deportations thrives in Nevada</a> - Las Vegas Review-Journal - For this story I talked at length with researchers in D.C. who studied the effects of immigration policies on undocumented youth. I was also able to speak with a top Harvard expert on issues concerning undocumented students.</p></li>


<li><p><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/naacp-outlines-goals-coming-election">NAACP outlines goals for coming election</a> - Las Vegas Review-Journal - This story ran on the front page the next day. I was supposed to feature comments from Harry Reid or Dina Titus but neither showed up. Instead, I changed the focus of the story to include more voices of the attendees.</p></li>



<li><p><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/tapped-las-vegas-brewer-plans-snag-blighted-building-boost-production">Tapped in: Las Vegas brewer plans to snag blighted building to boost production</a> - Las Vegas Review-Journal - While having a beer with a friend at a local bar, I learned that the popular brewery was expanding to a blighted area in Downtown Las Vegas -- a notable splash in the growing Vegas craft beer scene. The next day I began my internship by working on that story. </p></li>


<li><p><a href="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/storymapjs/latest/embed/?url=https://52b0d1246f0edec03393d93cf604dc4392af6393.googledrive.com/host/0Bw5LWUNQJBwlMS1sSlZ5eU80ejQ/published.json">Timeline: Deadly Home Invasion Spree</a> - Las Vegas Review-Journal - For this graphic, I used StoryMap from the Knightlab to create a digital component for a crime reporter's story on deadline</p></li>


<li><p><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/life/technology/syn-shop-hackerspace-equal-parts-fantastic-and-geeky">SYN Shop "hackerspace" equal parts fantastic and geeky</a> - Las Vegas Review-Journal - Before I arrived in Las Vegas, I researched the city and found that there was an emerging tech scene. By subscribing to a weekly tech newsletter, I heard about events such as the "Do it Yourself" meetup and attended. It turned out to be a good "evergreen" feature story and ran on the front of the Nevada section. </p></li>


<li><p><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/gun-found-near-las-vegas-boy-scout-was-unregistered-police-say">Gun found near Las Vegas Boy Scout was unregistered, police say</a> - Las Vegas Review-Journal - I followed up on the mystery surrounding a Las Vegas boy scout found dead in his tent in San Diego. I called the coroner's offices in San Diego and Las Vegas and discovered that the weapon found near the body was unregistered.</p></li>


<li><p><a href="https://voiceofsandiego.org/2013/07/17/writing-old-central-librarys-next-chapter/">Writing Old Central Library's Next Chapter</a>  - Voice of San Diego - While researching a story about underachieving "Task Forces" the mayor had put together, a member of one of the task forces mentioned that the library had been vacant for some time. This led me to research what would happen to it and what could happen to it, according to city planners, historical designation experts and city councilmembers. </p></li>


<li><p><a href="https://voiceofsandiego.org/2013/07/29/san-diegos-top-talking-head/">San Diego's Top Talking Head</a> - A profile that I did for Voice of San Diego - What makes Carl Luna an expert worthy of so many TV appearances? This is the question our newsroom asked. So I followed Luna around for two days to his TV appearances and then sat down for an interview. </p></li>


<li><p><a href="https://voiceofsandiego.org/2013/07/24/fact-check-a-redundant-homeless-shelter/">Fact Check: A 'Redundant' Homeless Shelter</a> - A small data story (and Fact Check) that I did for Voice of San Diego - After researching what could happen to the Old Library, I found out that one group in particular was submitting false claims about a nearby homeless shelter being under capacity in order to deter the library space from becoming a homeless shelter. I got the data to prove these claims false in the form of vacancy tallies from the homeless shelter in question. </p></li>


<li><p><a href="https://latinoreporter.org/missed-the-nahj-board-live-coverage-heres-your-recap/">Missed the NAHJ Board coverage? Here's your recap</a> - Live-tweeting for Latino Reporter - I showed off my live-tweeting skills at an NAHJ board meeting in San Antonio. Keeping an eye out for the most important information and not spamming Twitter was key. </p></li>


<li><p><a href="https://latinoreporter.org/nahj-la-chapter-president-accused-of-mishandling-funds/">NAHJ-LA chapter president accused of mishandling funds</a> - Investigative story for Latino Reporter - At the board meeting I learned that the NAHJ-LA president had been accused of mishandling funds. I reached out to all parties in question and also uploaded documents of the accusations. Disclaimer: I'm a student member of the chapter in question. </p></li>
