<p>My name is <a href="http://twitter.com/acoreynews">Alex Corey</a> and here's some of my work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://newamericamedia.org/2014/12/csus-lag-behind-ucs-in-creating-dream-centers.php">CSUs lag behind UCs in creating "Dream Centers"</a> - New America Media. Our campus bilingual publication has been covering undocumented students for years and when I saw that some CSU campuses were trying to create centers I decided to investigate why UC's had more resources despite serving fewer students in this situation. For this story, I met with sources in Long Beach, Los Angeles and the Valley in order to better understand the issue.</p></li>  


<li><p><a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/program-puts-child-deportations-thrives-nevada">Program that puts off child deportations thrives in Nevada</a> - Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p></li>For this story I talked at length with researchers in D.C. who studied the effects of immigration policies on undocumented youth. I was also able to speak with a top Harvard expert on issues concerning undocumented students. 

<li><p><a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/naacp-outlines-goals-coming-election">NAACP outlines goals for coming election</a> - Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p></li>This story ran on the front page the next day. I was supposed to feature comments from Harry Reid or Dina Titus but neither showed up. Instead, I changed the focus of the story to include more voices of the attendees. 

<li><p><a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/tapped-las-vegas-brewer-plans-snag-blighted-building-boost-production">Tapped in: Las Vegas brewer plans to snag blighted building to boost production</a> - Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p></li>While having a beer with a friend at a local bar, I learned that the bar was expanding to a blighted area in Downtown Las Vegas. The next day I began my internship by working on that story. Beginner's luck.

<li><p><a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/technology/syn-shop-hackerspace-equal-parts-fantastic-and-geeky">SYN Shop "hackerspace" equal parts fantastic and geeky</a> - Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/gun-found-near-las-vegas-boy-scout-was-unregistered-police-say">Gun found near Las Vegas Boy Scout was unregistered, police say</a> - Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p></li>I followed up on the mystery surrounded a Las Vegas boy scout found dead in his tent in San Diego. I called the coroner's office in San Diego and Las Vegas and discovered that the investigation had been turned over to Las Vegas police.

<li><p><a href="http://voiceofsandiego.org/2013/07/17/writing-old-central-librarys-next-chapter/">Writing Old Central Library's Next Chapter</a>  - A story that I wrote for Voice of San Diego.</p></li>While researching a story about underachieving "Task Forces" the mayor had put together, a member of one of the task forces mentioned that the library had been vacant for some time. This led me to research what would happen to it and what could happen to it, according to city planners, historical designation experts and city councilmen.

<li><p><a href="http://voiceofsandiego.org/2013/07/29/san-diegos-top-talking-head/">San Diego's Top Talking Head</a> - A profile that I wrote for Voice of San Diego.</p></li>What makes Carl Luna an expert worthy of so many TV appearances? This is the question our newsroom asked. So I followed Luna around for two days to his TV appearances and then sat down for an interview.

I got the data to prove these claims false in the form of vacancy tallies from the homeless shelter in question. 

<li><p><a href="http://latinoreporter.org/missed-the-nahj-board-live-coverage-heres-your-recap/">Missed the NAHJ Board coverage? Here's your recap</a> - Latino Reporter</p></li>I showed off my live-tweeting skills at an NAHJ board meeting in San Antonio. Keeping an eye out for the most important information and not spamming Twitter was key.

<li><p><a href="http://latinoreporter.org/nahj-la-chapter-president-accused-of-mishandling-funds/">NAHJ-LA chapter president accused of mishandling funds</a> - Latino Reporter</p></li>At the board meeting I learned that the NAHJ-LA president had been accused of misappropriating funds.
